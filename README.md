# Server-Anti-Lockout
! This is a work in progress and code has not been tested. !

A mechanism to prevent server lock outs by automatically reverting to an emergency configuration and/or reboot depending on a predefined set of factors. I mainly wrote this because everyone makes mistakes, lockouts can be extremely frustrating and because I hate using HP ILO.  

## Features Under Development
- All options fully configurable
- Builtin Tests to detect a lockout
- Builtin Procedures to mitigate common lockouts
- Ability to define custom tests and procedures
- Remote Ingress (Inbound) Testing Server 
- Push Notifications
- Security Checks and Logging
- Scriptable Install
